### A Web Blog Service For Code Education

This web blog service provides a lightening-fast pipeline to create readable and runnable tech-blog posts for elementary code tutors, and a comprehensible and do-able code blog posts for newbie code learners.

Etymologically, pitaka (पिटक) originated from buddhism, which means "basket or box made from bamboo or wood". It refers to "scripture or book" in plain english. There were 3 pitaka(s). Vinaya Piṭaka (“Basket of Discipline”), Sūtra Piṭaka (“Basket of Discourse”), and Abhidharma Piṭaka (“Basket of Special[or Further] Doctrine”). As so, this web blog service aims at providing readable, runnable and do-able code scriptures.
